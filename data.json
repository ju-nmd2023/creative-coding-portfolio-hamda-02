    "description": "This version draws pure black lines that twist and overlap in a chaotic way until the canvas is filled. I removed the interaction, so the flow happens automatically. I added random stroke weights, giving it a hand-drawn energy, and I also made the particles flow in opposite directions this time, instead of just one."
